# RetroRemakes
Trying my hand at remaking old games to improve my coding skills.

Initial graphics setup with OpenGL following a [Udemy course by Ben Cook](https://www.udemy.com/share/101WyO3@YCw6T4hYoN1rafesjrPKdICk3ys_AkdEzJVbEfLiFPpRO6KDBmWzm6uyxqyWw3Wb/). It uses the following external libraries:
- [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp)
- [GLEW](https://glew.sourceforge.net/)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [glm](http://glm.g-truc.net/)
- [stb_image](https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h)

Goals:
- [ ] Snake
- [ ] Breakout
- [ ] Asteroids
- [ ] PacMan
- [ ] Donkey Kong

Stretch Goal:
- [ ] Create an arcade level to access each game
